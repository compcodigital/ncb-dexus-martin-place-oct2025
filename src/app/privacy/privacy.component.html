        providers are located overseas.</p>
    <p>If you hold an investment that is issued overseas, the details of the rules relevant to that investment product
        were notified to you in the product offer document. If you are a securityholder residing outside Australia, we
        may also provide your information to authorities of the jurisdiction in which you reside such as tax
        authorities, banks and other permitted bodies to make distribution and dividend payments, comply with the laws
        of that jurisdiction and communicate with you or your representatives.</p>
    <p>Some of our hotel and technology service providers also provide hosting of our data in countries outside of
        Australia, including the United States, Singapore and Japan.</p>
    <h3><strong>How do we store and protect your personal information?</strong></h3>
    <p>We store personal information both electronically and in hard copy form, both at our premises and with the
        assistance of our service providers, including several cloud service providers. We have a number of security
        controls which we apply in relation to our people, processes and technology including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>internal data handling policies; and</li>
        <li>reasonable IT network security measures such as intrusion detection and anti-virus applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as completely secure.&nbsp; While we strive to
        protect our data and are continually reviewing our security systems to improve them, we cannot ensure or warrant
        the absolute security of the data we collect.</p>
    <h3><strong>Data breach response</strong></h3>
    <p>Please notify us immediately if you become aware of any misuse, interference or loss or any authorised access,
        modification or disclosure of personal information held by us (“Data Breach”) or any other security breach
        affecting data held by us using the contact details provided at the end of this policy.</p>
    <p>If we become aware of a Data Breach, we will promptly investigate the incident, and take reasonable steps to
        contain and remedy the breach.&nbsp; To help you maintain the security of your personal information, we will
        take steps to notify you as soon as practicable if we believe that the Data Breach would likely result in
        serious harm to you.&nbsp; Where possible, we will provide you with recommendations on the steps that you can
        take in response to the breach.</p>
    <p>After investigating a Data Breach, we may disclose information to the Office of the Australian Information
        Commissioner and to law enforcement agencies about the incident in order to comply with our reporting
        obligations under the Privacy Act, and to enable the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and law
        enforcement agencies to investigate the incident.</p>
